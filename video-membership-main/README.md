# Video Membership

Created a Video Membership app using FastAPI & NoSQL. In this project, I've tried to build a membership application using FastAPI and a managed Cassandra database called [AstraDB](https://dtsx.io/3lAUmnG).

In this one, a number of key features in building a video membership site includes:

- Creating Users (with custom fields) from scratch
- Saving Secure, Hashed, Passwords
- Authentication
- Video Analytics & Resumable Videos
- Search Engine
- And much more
